Question:
Write a program in Java to simulate a student management system. Follow these instructions:

Create a class named Student with the following attributes:

String studentID: to store the unique ID of the student.
String name: to store the student’s name.
double grade: to store the student's grade.
Include the following methods in the Student class:

A constructor to initialize the student's details.
void updateGrade(double newGrade): to update the student’s grade.
void displayDetails(): to display the student’s details.
In the main method:

Methods for Each Functionality:

addStudent(): Adds a new student to the array.
viewAllStudents(): Displays details of all students.
searchStudentByID(): Searches and displays a student based on their ID.
viewStudentByPosition(): Displays the details of a student at a specific position in the array.
Encapsulation of Logic:

By separating logic into methods, the program is modular and easier to understand.
