 Explanation:
Modular Design:
Create a class named Product with the following attributes:

String productID: to store the unique ID of the product.
String name: to store the name of the product.
int quantity: to store the number of items available in stock.
Include the following methods in the Product class:

A constructor to initialize the product’s details.
void restock(int amount): to add more items to the stock.
void sell(int amount): to sell items from the stock, ensuring that the stock does not go negative. If insufficient stock is available, display an appropriate message.
void displayDetails(): to display the product’s details.
In the main method:

The program is modular with methods for specific tasks:
addProduct(): Adds a new product to the array.
viewAllProducts(): Displays all products in the inventory.
searchProductByID(): Searches for a product by its ID.
viewProductByPosition(): Displays a product at a specific position.
Array-Based Storage:

Uses a fixed-size array products to store products.
Limits the inventory to 5 products for simplicity.
