Question:
Write a program in Java that simulates a bank account system. Follow these instructions:

Create a class named BankAccount with the following attributes:
String accountNumber: to store the account number.
String accountHolder: to store the name of the account holder.
double balance: to store the current balance in the account.
Include the following methods in the BankAccount class:
A constructor to initialize the attributes.
void deposit(double amount): to add money to the balance.
void withdraw(double amount): to deduct money from the balance if sufficient funds are available, otherwise display an appropriate message.
void displayDetails(): to print the account details.


Features:
Add Bank Account: Creates a new account (up to 5).
View All Accounts: Lists all accounts with details.
Deposit/Withdraw Money: Allows transactions by entering the account number.
View Account Details: Fetches and displays details for a specific account using its account number.

Modular Design:
Methods like addAccount, viewAllAccounts, depositMoney, withdrawMoney, and viewAccountDetails handle individual tasks.
Helper Method:
findAccountByNumber searches the array for an account with a given account number.
Fixed Array:
Uses an array of size 5 for simplicity, with accountCount tracking the current number of accounts.
