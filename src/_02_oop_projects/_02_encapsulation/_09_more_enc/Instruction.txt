Exercise 1: Create a Class with Encapsulation
Task:

Task A:

Create a class Car with the following private fields:

brand (String)
model (String)
year (int)
Add getter and setter methods for each field.

Write a main method to:

Create an object of the Car class.
Set values for the fields using setters.
Retrieve and print the values using getters.


Task B:

Exercise 2: Add Validation to Setters
Task:

Modify the Car class from Exercise 1 to include validation in the setters:

year must be greater than 1885 (the year the first car was invented).
brand and model should not be empty strings.
If invalid data is provided, print an error message and do not update the field.

Test the validation in your main method.

Task C:

Exercise 3: Calculate the Age of a Car
Task:

Add a method getCarAge() in the Car class that calculates the age of the car based on the current year.

Use the LocalDate class to get the current year.

Write a main method to:

Create a Car object.
Set its fields.
Print the car's age using the getCarAge() method.

Exercise 4: Add validation to check the year is not in the future

Hint: add the logic to the setYear() method
