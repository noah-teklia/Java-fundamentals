Problem 1:

A) Create a superclass BankAccount with the following attributes:

String accountNumber: to store the account number.
String accountHolder: to store the name of the account holder.
double balance: to store the current balance in the account.
Include the following methods in the BankAccount class:

Constructor: To initialize the accountNumber, accountHolder, and balance attributes.
void deposit(double amount): To add money to the balance.
void withdraw(double amount): To deduct money from the balance if sufficient funds are available; otherwise, display an appropriate message.
void displayDetails(): To print the account details.

B) Create subclasses that extend the BankAccount class with specific behaviors:
BusinessAccount:

Include an additional attribute double creditLimit.
Override the withdraw method to allow overdrafts up to the creditLimit.
PersonalAccount:

Include an additional attribute double maintenanceFee.
Add a method void deductMaintenanceFee() to deduct the fee from the balance.
SavingAccount:

Include an additional attribute double interestRate.
Add a method void addInterest() to calculate and add interest to the balance.
CheckingAccount:

Include an additional attribute int transactionLimit.
Add a method to check if the transaction limit is exceeded and display an appropriate message.

C) In the main method:
Accept user input to create objects of BusinessAccount, PersonalAccount, SavingAccount, and CheckingAccount.
Provide a menu-driven console interface with the following options:
Deposit money into the account.
Withdraw money from the account.
Display account details.
Perform subclass-specific actions:
Deduct maintenance fee (PersonalAccount).
Add interest (SavingAccount).
Check transaction limit (CheckingAccount).
Exit the program
