Shape Calculator
Problem Statement:
Write a program in Java to calculate the area and perimeter of shapes using inheritance. Follow these instructions:

1)Create an abstract superclass Shape with the following methods:

abstract double calculateArea(): To calculate the area of the shape.
abstract double calculatePerimeter(): To calculate the perimeter of the shape.
Create subclasses that extend the Shape class:

2) Circle:

Include an attribute double radius.
Implement the abstract methods to calculate the area and perimeter.
3)Rectangle:

Include attributes double length and double width.
Implement the abstract methods to calculate the area and perimeter.
4)Triangle:

Include attributes double side1, double side2, and double side3.
Implement the abstract methods to calculate the area and perimeter using Heron's formula.
In the main method:

Provide a menu-driven console interface to:
Add a new shape to the array.
Calculate and display the area and perimeter of all shapes.
Exit the program.
