#3 Vehicle Management System
Problem Statement:
Write a program in Java to simulate a vehicle management system using inheritance. Follow these instructions:

1) Create a superclass Vehicle with the following attributes:

String make: to store the vehicle's make.
String model: to store the vehicle's model.
int year: to store the vehicle's manufacturing year.
Include the following methods in the Vehicle class:

Constructor: To initialize the make, model, and year.
void displayDetails(): To print the vehicle details.

2) Create subclasses that extend the Vehicle class:

Car:

Include an additional attribute int numberOfDoors.
Override the displayDetails() method to include the number of doors.
Truck:

Include an additional attribute double loadCapacity.
Override the displayDetails() method to include the load capacity.
Motorcycle:

Include an additional attribute boolean hasSidecar.
Override the displayDetails() method to include whether it has a sidecar.

3) In the main method:

Create an array of Vehicle objects to store instances of Car, Truck, and Motorcycle.
Provide a menu-driven console interface to:
Add a new vehicle to the array.
Display details of all vehicles.
Exit the program.
