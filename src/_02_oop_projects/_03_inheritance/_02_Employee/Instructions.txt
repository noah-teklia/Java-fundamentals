Employee Management System
Problem Statement:
Write a program in Java to simulate an employee management system using inheritance. Follow these instructions:

1)Create a superclass Employee with the following attributes:

String employeeID: to store the employee's ID.
String name: to store the employee's name.
double salary: to store the employee's salary.
Include the following methods in the Employee class:

Constructor: To initialize the employeeID, name, and salary.
void displayDetails(): To print the employee details.

2) Create subclasses that extend the Employee class:

  Manager:

  Include an additional attribute double bonus.
  Override the displayDetails() method to include the bonus.
  Developer:

  Include an additional attribute String programmingLanguage.
  Override the displayDetails() method to include the programming language.
  Salesperson:

  Include an additional attribute double salesAchieved.
  Override the displayDetails() method to include the sales achieved.

  3) In the main method:

  Create an array of Employee objects to store instances of Manager, Developer, and Salesperson.
  Provide a menu-driven console interface to:
  Add a new employee to the list.
  Display details of all employees.
  Exit the program.
