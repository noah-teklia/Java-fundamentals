Library Management System with Modular Menu and Advanced Features

Design and implement a Library Management System in Java that follows these requirements:

Core Classes and Features:
LibraryItem (Abstract Class):

Attributes:
String itemID: A unique identifier for each item in the library.
String title: The title of the library item.
boolean isBorrowed: Indicates whether the item is currently borrowed.
String borrowedBy: Stores the user ID of the borrower (if borrowed).
Methods:
void displayItemDetails(): An abstract method to display details of the library item.
void borrowItem(String userID): Allows a user to borrow the item (throws an exception if already borrowed).
void returnItem(): Allows a user to return the borrowed item (throws an exception if not borrowed).


Book (Concrete Class):

Extends LibraryItem and includes:
String author: Stores the name of the author of the book.
Implements the displayItemDetails() method to show all book details.

User:

Attributes:
String userID: A unique identifier for each user.
String name: The name of the user.
int borrowedItemCount: Tracks the number of items currently borrowed by the user.

Methods:
void displayUserDetails(): Displays the user's details.


LibraryManagementSystem:

Manages the core functionality of the library, including:
Adding library items (e.g., books).
Adding users.
Borrowing and returning items.
Viewing all items and users.


Menu Structure:
Implement a menu-driven program using abstract classes or interfaces to create a modular structure for handling different menus:

MainMenu (Abstract Class Implementation):

Options:
1. Manage Library Items (navigates to the Library Items menu).
2. Manage Users (navigates to the User Management menu).
3. Borrow Item: Allows a user to borrow an item by entering their user ID and the item ID.
4. Return Item: Allows a user to return an item by entering its ID.
5. Exit: Exits the program.
LibraryItemsMenu:

Options:
1. Add Book: Prompts the user for book details and adds it to the library.
2. View All Items: Displays all items in the library, along with their borrowed status.
3. Back to Main Menu.
UsersMenu:

Options:
1. Add User: Prompts the user to input user details and adds them to the system.
2. View All Users: Displays a list of all registered users.
3. Back to Main Menu.


Exception Handling:
Throw exceptions in the following cases:
Trying to borrow an item that is already borrowed.
Trying to return an item that is not borrowed.
A user exceeds the maximum borrowing limit (3 items).

Requirements:
Use an abstract class for the LibraryItem hierarchy.
Use an abstract class or interface to design the modular menu structure.
Ensure proper encapsulation and separation of concerns.
Handle invalid inputs gracefully with appropriate error messages.
