Problem: Online Bookstore Management System
You are tasked with building an Online Bookstore Management System where users can:
Sign up for a new account (with email, password, and role).
Log in with their credentials.
View available books.
Purchase books (reduce stock after purchase).
Return books (restock returned items).
View purchased books.

Admins will have additional privileges:
Add new books to the bookstore.
Update book stock.
View all registered users.
Deactivate users (temporarily deactivate a user).
The system should also handle the following:
Advanced user management: Users have a status (active, deactivated) and can be reactivated by an admin.
User roles: Users are either admin or customer, and admins can perform higher-level tasks.
Validations for email format and unique usernames.

Steps and Interactive Console Flow
Step 1: Menu Setup
Start by presenting the main menu to the user. The menu should allow them to:
Sign up
Log in
Exit

Step 2: Sign Up
The sign-up process asks for:
Username (email): Must be unique and in email format (e.g., user@example.com).
Password: At least 6 characters long.
Role: Choose between admin or customer.
Validate the email format and ensure the username is unique.
Sample Interactive Console Output:

Sign-up successful! You can now log in.

Step 3: Login
The login process allows users to log in using their email and password. Ensure that:
The email is registered.
The password matches.
The user's status is active (deactivated users cannot log in).
Admins and customers will have different menus upon logging in.
Sample Interactive Console Output:
